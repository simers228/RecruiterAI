       "29  Licensed Professional Engineer focused on providing facility condition assessments and developing go-forward strategies for clients to achieve their organizational mission. The assessment services provides our customers with the in-depth reporting and documentation of existing facilities and its infrastructure.  We then can develop prioritized deferred maintenance options, develop concepts and options for new facility strategies, identify scope, develop detailed financial budget, provide detailed analysis of the various options, total cost of ownership, and develop a recommended project schedule, in order to bring a project to realization and creation.  Once projects progress past the assessment phase, the goal will be to provide and end-to-end reliability of the overall project scope, schedule and budget.  Our goal with an assessment is to help our customers identify their needs, identify their requirements, develop a scope, schedule and budget to help them \"tell the story\" of what they currently have and what they will need to do to meet their organizations overall strategy.     \n",

       "29  Licensed Professional Engineer focused on providing facility condition assessments and developing go-forward strategies for clients to achieve their organizational mission. The assessment services provides our customers with the in-depth reporting and documentation of existing facilities and its infrastructure.  We then can develop prioritized deferred maintenance options, develop concepts and options for new facility strategies, identify scope, develop detailed financial budget, provide detailed analysis of the various options, total cost of ownership, and develop a recommended project schedule, in order to bring a project to realization and creation.  Once projects progress past the assessment phase, the goal will be to provide and end-to-end reliability of the overall project scope, schedule and budget.  Our goal with an assessment is to help our customers identify their needs, identify their requirements, develop a scope, schedule and budget to help them \"tell the story\" of what they currently have and what they will need to do to meet their organizations overall strategy.     \n",
