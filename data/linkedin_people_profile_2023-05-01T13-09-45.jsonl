There was a whole team of professionals working to put those construction documents together and the estimator gets the task of digging into it, just like uncovering a mystery.  Peeling back the pages and following the puzzle pieces around the entire set until you solve it.  The more you work the plan, the sooner the designer's intent becomes clear.  Finishing the estimate gives you that road map to complete the project correctly.  Division by division, section by section, finding the right teammate to fulfill each responsibility and carry it through to the end of another successful project.  I'm very proud to have had the opportunity to perform these tasks with, and gain knowledge from, some of the best and the brightest in the Midwest.", "experience": [{"organisation_profile": "https://se.linkedin.com/company/the-boldt-company", "location": "Cloquet, Minnesota, United States", "description": "", "start_time": "Jan 2023", "end_time": "present", "duration": null}, {"organisation_profile": "https://se.linkedin.com/company/essentia-health", "location": "Duluth, Minnesota, United States", "description": "", "start_time": "May 2022", "end_time": "Jan 2023", "duration": null}, {"organisation_profile": "https://se.linkedin.com/company/j-r-jensen-construction-company", "location": "Superior, WI", "description": "", "start_time": "May 2019", "end_time": "Apr 2022", "duration": null}, {"organisation_profile": "https://se.linkedin.com/company/a-b-systems-inc", "location": "", "description": "", "start_time": "Jun 2011", "end_time": "May 2019", "duration": null}, {"organisation_profile": "https://se.linkedin.com/company/the-joseph-company-inc", "location": "", "description": "Estimating, design, sales, management of commercial construction projects.", "start_time": "Aug 2005", "end_time": "Jun 2011", "duration": null}, {"organisation_profile": "", "location": "Lake Mills, Iowa, United States", "description": "", "start_time": "1999", "end_time": "2005", "duration": null}], "education": [{"organisation": "", "organisation_profile": "https://se.linkedin.com/school/southcentralcollege/", "course_details": "", "description": ""}]}
