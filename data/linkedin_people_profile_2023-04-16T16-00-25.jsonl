My past experience within the company gave me the ability to manage a job alongside a foreman. My daily duties included toolbox safety meetings, coordination of crew members, meeting with inspectors/subcontractors, tracking quantities, logging diary's and completing time. The project consisted of a complete road reconstruction on highway US 220 with the addition of two passing lanes, two turnarounds and an acceleration and deceleration lane. Due to this project being an A+B bid we were tasked with preparing the subgrade, installing culvert extensions and all proper SWPPP without impeding traffic. Once subgrade was to grade I was able to aid the foreman in the coordination of belly dumps while placing base 30,000 ton of base course. I learned the hard way to proof roll subgrade before placing base. On the acceleration lane the compaction passed density tests performed by Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT). As base was placed the subgrade was noticeably pumping due to excessive moisture. Using a paddle wheel the base that was placed was scavenged and placed on the deceleration lane. Geogrid fabric was then placed on the subgrade in order to stabilize and allow the base to bridge over into a solid surface. As base finished being placed I was able to communicate with the millers. Trucks were coordinated to be loaded by the mill as 10% of of the asphalt mix design included Recycled Asphalt Product (RAP). In the process of milling I took a role in aiding the traffic control crew as the mill would switch sides of the road in the process. Tabs were needed to be placed until the coordination of stripping took place with a subcontractor. I was able to aid in the process of opening and closing lanes in accordance with WYDOT standards. This experience taught me valuable lessons and allowed me to gain knowledge in heavy highway construction.", "start_time": "May 2021", "end_time": "Aug 2021", "duration": "4 months"}, {"organisation_profile": "https://fr.linkedin.com/company/knife-river-corporation", "location": "Casper, Wyoming, United States", "description": "Throughout my connections made in both college and life I obtained a position as an intern working for Knife River Corporation in Casper, Wyoming. With my previous experience I was assigned to work alongside the Construction Superintendent. Throughout my internship I acted as a Project Engineer on an eight mile road reconstruction. Being in the field everyday taught me valuable information that cannot be taught in a classroom. While in the field I was able to get involved in the process of locating utilities, topsoil removal, culvert installation, subgrade preparation, placement of geogrid, and the placement and finishing of base course. While being actively involved in this task I was able to access the plans and specifications in order to make decisions and inform the crew I worked alongside. I was also in charge of keeping track of incoming inventory, quantities of material hauled to site and daily production analysis. Production analysis was completed using Heavy Job where employee's times, equipment usage, amount of material, and other resources used were placed into the software in order to determine the budget of the job from day to day. Along with the use of HCCS Plans, Heavy Job, Mobile Iron, and Microsoft Office/Teams I was also introduced to TopCon GPS Systems which I was able to use extensively. The constant use of TopCon allowed me to visualize each layer of the project. I was able to see how to incorporate the use of the GPS to link to equipment in order to place culvert pipe and build each layer of the road surface to the precise measurements. The use of TopCon has benefited me greatly as it is becoming a key role in the construction industry, the in-depth training I received on this GPS software will benefit me time and time again.
